# Basic interaction with a local language model

This script was developed by Claude 3.5. It helps me understand the basic structure for interacting with a local language model.

## To use this script:
Install the required library: `pip install ctransformers`
Replace `"path/to/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_S.gguf"` with the actual path to your model file.
Run the script: `python app.py`

## Use LM Studio to get oper source LLM model. It will be saved in this folder.
